# Online-resume-builder
Hey , I have built an online resume builder using java , JDBC .
An online resume builder developed in Java using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) provides users with a platform to create professional resumes conveniently. Leveraging JDBC, this application allows users to store, manage, and retrieve resume data efficiently from a database. Users can input their personal information, educational background, work experience, skills, and other relevant details through an intuitive user interface. The JDBC functionality enables seamless integration with a database backend, facilitating secure storage and retrieval of resume information. Through this online tool, users can create, edit, and update their resumes at any time, ensuring accessibility and ease of use. The JDBC framework ensures robust connectivity between the Java application and the database, ensuring reliable data handling for an effective resume-building experience.
